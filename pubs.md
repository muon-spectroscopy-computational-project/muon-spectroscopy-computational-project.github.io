* [Computational Prediction of Muon Stopping Sites Using AIRSS](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5024450 )\
**_The Journal of Chemical Physics, 148, 134114, (2018)_**\
The stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment (µ+SR) is generally unknown and there few techniques that can be used to determine the muon stopping site. In this work, we propose a purely theoretical method that can be used to predict muon stopping sites in crystalline materials using only computer simulations.

**_The Journal of Chemical Physics, 150, 154301, (2019)_**\
Expanding on our previous use of AIRSS to find the muon stopping site, this paper focuses on its application to organic molecules and shows how the tight binding software DFTB+, combined with the `3ob-3-1` parameter set, can produce satisfying results for it in a fraction of the time required by DFT simulations.

Phenylacetylene-capped silicon nanoparticles have attracted interest as a novel thermoelectric material. In this paper, we report a combined muon spectroscopic (μSR) and computational study of this material in solution to investigate the microscopic electronic structure of this system.

* [Computational prediction of muon stopping sites: A novel take on the unperturbed electrostatic potential method](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0012381)\
**_The Journal of Chemical Physics, 153, 044111, (2020)_**\
In this work, we present a software implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Potential (UEP) Method: an approach used for finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The UEP method requires only one DFT calculation, necessary to compute the electronic density of the host material.

**_X-Ray Spectrometry,1–17, (2020)_**\
In this work, we present mudirac: a new open‐source software for the integration of the radial Dirac equation developed specifically for muonic atoms. The software can be used to predict frequencies and transitions probabilities between levels of the muonic atom, which are useful for the interpretation of muonic X‐ray spectra in elemental analysis.

* [Low-temperature magnetic crossover in the topological kagome magnet TbMn<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>6</sub>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00885-4)\
**_Communications Physics volume 5, Article number: 107, (2022)_**\
Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the recently identified topological kagome system TbMn<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>6</sub> using muon spin rotation, combined with local field analysis and neutron diffraction. Our studies identify an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic structure with slow magnetic fluctuations which exhibit a critical slowing down below T<sup>*</sup><sub>C1</sub> ≃ 120 K and finally freeze into static patches with ideal out-of-plane order below T<sub>C1</sub> ≃ 20 K.

* [MuSpinSim: spin dynamics calculations for muon science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2462/1/012017/meta)\
**_J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 2462 012017, (2023)_**\

* [Magnetic structure and crystal field states of Pr<sub>2</sub>Pd<sub>3</sub>Ge<sub>5</sub>: μSR and neutron scattering investigations](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.104412)\
**_Phys.Rev.B 107,104412, (2023)_**\
In this work, we present the results of muon spin relaxation (μSR), powder neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering investigations on polycrystalline Pr<sub>2</sub>Pd<sub>3</sub>Ge<sub>5</sub>. The material exhibits dual antiferromagnetic transitions, confirmed by heat capacity measurements. Our findings reveal a canted antiferromagnetic structure of ordered Pr<sup>3+</sup> moments. The internal field calculations at muon stopping sites predicted by DFT calculation are in good agreement with experimental observations. In the paramagnetic state, 3 crystal electric field excitations were identified arising from the crystal electric field split J=4 ground state of Pr<sup>3+</sup>.

* [Hidden magnetism uncovered in a charge ordered bilayer kagome material ScV<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>6</sub>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43503-9)\
**_Nat Commun 14, 7796, (2023)_**\
Here, we present the discovery of an unnexpected hidden magnetism of the charge orger for the recently discovered charge ordered kagome material - ScV<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>6</sub> using advanced muon-spin rotation spectroscopy. An enhancement was observed in the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble, which takes place within the charge ordered state. Furthermore, the muon spin relaxation rate below the charge ordering temperature is substantially enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. Taken together with the hidden magnetism found in AV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> (A = K, Rb, Cs) and FeGe kagome systems, our results suggest ubiqitous time-reversal symmetry-breaking in charge ordered kagome lattices.
