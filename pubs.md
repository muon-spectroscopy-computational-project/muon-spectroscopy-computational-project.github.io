In this work, we used a number of different computational techniques to study the temperature dependence of the Avoided Level Crossing spectrum of crystalline benzene.

The stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment (mu+SR) is generally unknown and there few techniques that can be used to determine the muon stopping site. In this work, we propose a purely theoretical method that can be used to predict muon stopping sites in crystalline materials using only computer simulations.

Expanding on our previous use of AIRSS to find the muon stopping site, this paper focuses on its application to organic molecules and shows how the tight binding software DFTB+, combined with the `3ob-3-1` parameter set, can produce satisfying results for it in a fraction of the time required by DFT simulations.

Phenylacetylene-capped silicon nanoparticles have attracted interest as a novel thermoelectric material. In this paper, we report a combined muon spectroscopic (μSR) and computational study of this material in solution to investigate the microscopic electronic structure of this system.

**_The Journal of Chemical Physics, 153, 044111 (2020)_**
In this work, we present a software implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Potential (UEP) Method: an approach used for finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The UEP method requires only one DFT calculation, necessary to compute the electronic density of the host material.

This work focuses on the paramagnetic states formed by muons in semiconductors. In particular, it revisits the case of muons in pure Si, and uses a combination of computational methods to estimate the muon stopping sites.

This presentation discusses the computational methods that we had developed so far to estimate the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The key new concept is the development of methods based on calculations other than ab-initio calculations. The idea is that the new calculations are computationally faster than the purely ab initio ones. One of the methods that I have tested is the DFT-based Tight-Binding.

This talk presentes the key concepts and the main approximations used in our computer models, and also discusses why some of these approximations are relevant to muon experiments. In particular, there is a brief introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT) and how it can be used to study muonated molecular and crystalline systems. This talk also presents the basis for the method that we are developing to predict the muon stopping sites in crystalline materials.
