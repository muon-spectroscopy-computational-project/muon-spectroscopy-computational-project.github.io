    <p><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5024450">Computational Prediction of Muon Stopping Sites Using AIRSS</a>\
<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 148, 134114, (2018)</em></strong>\
The stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment (mu+SR) is generally unknown and there few techniques that can be used to determine the muon stopping site. In this work, we propose a purely theoretical method that can be used to predict muon stopping sites in crystalline materials using only computer simulations.</p>

    <p><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5085197">Comparison between Density Functional Theory and Density Functional Tight Binding approaches for finding the muon stopping site in organic molecular crystals</a>\
<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 150, 154301, (2019)</em></strong>\
Expanding on our previous use of AIRSS to find the muon stopping site, this paper focuses on its application to organic molecules and shows how the tight binding software DFTB+, combined with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">3ob-3-1</code> parameter set, can produce satisfying results for it in a fraction of the time required by DFT simulations.</p>

    <p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b11717">A Muon Spectroscopic and Computational Study of the Microscopic Electronic Structure in Thermoelectric Hybrid Silicon Nanostructures</a>\
<strong><em>J. Phys. Chem. C, 124, 18, 9656–9664, (2020)</em></strong>\
Phenylacetylene-capped silicon nanoparticles have attracted interest as a novel thermoelectric material. In this paper, we report a combined muon spectroscopic (μSR) and computational study of this material in solution to investigate the microscopic electronic structure of this system.</p>

    <p><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0012381">Computational prediction of muon stopping sites: A novel take on the unperturbed electrostatic potential method</a>\
<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 153, 044111 (2020)</em></strong>\
In this work, we present a software implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Potential (UEP) Method: an approach used for finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The UEP method requires only one DFT calculation, necessary to compute the electronic density of the host material.</p>

    <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/xrs.3212">Mudirac: A Dirac equation solver for elemental analysis with muonic X‐rays</a>\
<strong><em>X-Ray Spectrometry,1–17, (2020)</em></strong>\
In this work, we present mudirac: a new open‐source software for the integration of the radial Dirac equation developed specifically for muonic atoms. The software can be used to predict frequencies and transitions probabilities between levels of the muonic atom, which are useful for the interpretation of muonic X‐ray spectra in elemental analysis.</p>

<strong><em>Phys.Rev.B 104,064429, (2021)</em></strong>\
Here, we give evidence for the detection of a muonium state that propagates in a molecular semiconductor lattice via thermally activated dynamics: a muonium polaron.</p>

<strong><em>Communications Physics volume 5, Article number: 107 (2022)</em></strong>\
Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the recently identified topological kagome system TbMn6Sn6 using muon spin rotation, combined with local field analysis and neutron diffraction. Our studies identify an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic structure with slow magnetic fluctuations which exhibit a critical slowing down below T<sup>*</sup>C1 ≃ 120 K and finally freeze into static patches with ideal out-of-plane order below TC1 ≃ 20 K.</p>

<strong><em>The 14th International Conference on Muon Spin Rotation, Relaxation and Resonance. 30 June 2017, Sapporo, Japan.</em></strong>\
This work focuses on the paramagnetic states formed by muons in semiconductors. In particular, it revisits the case of muons in pure Si, and uses a combination of computational methods to estimate the muon stopping sites.</p>

<strong><em>Muon Spectroscopy User Meeting: Future Developments and Site Calculations.
 17 July 2018, The Cosener’s House, Abingdon, UK.</em></strong>\
This presentation discusses the computational methods that we had developed so far to estimate the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The key new concept is the development of methods based on calculations other than ab-initio calculations. The idea is that the new calculations are computationally faster than the purely ab initio ones. One of the methods that I have tested is the DFT-based Tight-Binding.</p>

<strong><em>The 2018 ISIS Muon Spectroscopy Training School.  22 March 2018, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell, UK.</em></strong>\
This talk presents the key concepts and the main approximations used in our computer models, and also discusses why some of these approximations are relevant to muon experiments. In particular, there is a brief introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT) and how it can be used to study muonated molecular and crystalline systems. This talk also presents the basis for the method that we are developing to predict the muon stopping sites in crystalline materials.</p>
