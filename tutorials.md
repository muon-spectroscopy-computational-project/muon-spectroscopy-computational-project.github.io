### Tutorials

If you are interested in using the tools developed by the MSCP, in this page
you can find a number of tutorials designed to help you take the first steps.
Most of our tools at the moment come bundled in the 
[`pymuon-suite`](https://github.com/muon-spectroscopy-computational-project/pymuon-suite) 
Python package, but they also make use of other Python libraries, such as the 
[Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) and
[Soprano](https://ccp-nc.github.io/soprano/).

`pymuon-suite` was deployed specifically to aid muon computational science: is a library that can be
found on Github and is released under a GNU v3.0 open source license. Once installed, `pymuon-suite` 
provides the user both with a Python API to use for custom programs and with a series of pre-packaged
scripts that can be used to interpret some of the most common muon experiments. 

Some tutorials require at least a working knowledge of Python, others don't.
We will keep the tutorials classified depending on the skills that they
require. Don't worry though - none of them are very hard to get through. Even
if you don't know how to use a command line or how to write Python scripts, 
this could be a good point to start!
