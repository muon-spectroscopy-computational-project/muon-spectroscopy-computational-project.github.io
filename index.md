This is the page of the Muon Spectroscopy Computational project, a project
aimed at developing software and methods to help experimental scientists, in the field
of muon spectroscopy, understand and better interpret their results with the
help of state-of-the-art computational techniques.

The project is a joint collaboration of the UKRI 
[Scientific Computing Department](https://stfc.ukri.org/about-us/where-we-work/daresbury-laboratory/scientific-computing-department/)
and the [ISIS Muon Group](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Muons.aspx), which
provides the funding. More information about the people involved can be found
[here](people).

The project's aim is to provide support and software to address the following
outstanding problems in muon spectroscopy:

* Identification of the muon stopping site in different classes of commonly
studied systems by means of simulations of appropriate level of accuracy
(unperturbed electrostatic potential, tight binding, density functional
theory);

* Estimation of quantum effects involving the muon and their effect on
stopping site stability and spectral dynamics;

* Prediction of frequencies and probabilities of transition between energy levels of muonic atoms. This is a tool that helps
with the interpretation of muonic X-ray spectra for elemental analysis.

* Integration of multiple computational tools to create a simplified pipeline
from low level theory to experiment simulation.
